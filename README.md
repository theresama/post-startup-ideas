Individual assignment for CSC309: Programming on the Web.
This is a simple web project that allows users to submit ideas for start up companies. A start-up idea includes information about the title of the idea, a short description (a couple of paragraphs), the industry or market it belongs to from a list of at least 5 pre-defined choices (e.g., health, technology, education, finance, travel, etc.) and a set of relevant keywords/tags that better describe it. In order to submit an idea, a user needs to be registered in the service by providing a name, an email address (that serves as a login) and a password. Moreover, a registered user can navigate the list of already registered start-up ideas and filter ideas by industry/market, by keyword/tag or sort them by name or date of submission. In addition, a registered user can express her preference to an idea by liking or disliking it.

1. User can register in the service.
2. User can login (session is created) and logout from the service (session has to be deleted).
3. User can post new start-up ideas.
4. User can see her submitted start-up ideas and can edit or delete an idea.
5. User can navigate already submitted ideas of other users.
6. User can see details of a specific idea (an individual page for each idea is expected).
7. User can express preference in favor or against an idea (like or dislike function).
